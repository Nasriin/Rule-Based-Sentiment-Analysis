it looks good but it is essentially emptyit is mildly amusing but i certainly cannot recommend itit is a big idea but the film itself is small and shriveledbisset delivers a game performance but she is unable to save the moviesome elements of it really blow the big one but other parts are decentthis 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes but it is a slow tadi have seen some bad singer-turned actors but lil bow wow takes the cakeit is a very sincere work but it would be betterit is not the worst comedy of the year but it certainly wont win any honorsstar trek was terrific once but now it is a copy of a copy of a copylucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless but it is also drab and inert the original was not a good movie but this remake makes it like a masterpiece
it treats women like idiots
it is actually pretty funny but in all the wrong places
